The provided code does not seem to have any usage of Managed Service Identities (MSIs) and no hardcoded secrets, so it complies with the checklist items 3.1 and 3.2. 

However, the code does not fully comply with the unit testing requirements. 

Here are the issues:

1. The `Add` methods in the first class do not have corresponding unit tests. 

2. There's a test case for `MyMath.Add` method, but there's no test case for edge cases. 

3. `GetKey` and `GetValue` methods also don't have corresponding unit tests.

4. The `IsPrime_ValuesLessThan2_ReturnFalse` method seems to be a test case, but it's not clear which method it is testing. If it's testing a method from `MyMath` class, that method is not provided in the given code.

Here are the suggested modifications:

1. Write unit tests for `Add`, `GetKey`, and `GetValue` methods.

2. For `MyMath.Add` method, add test cases that cover edge cases. For example, what happens when the sum of `a` and `b` is larger than the maximum value for a double?

3. If `IsPrime_ValuesLessThan2_ReturnFalse` is a test case for a method in `MyMath` class, ensure that the method is included in the `MyMath` class.

4. Make sure all test methods are under a test class and are marked with the `[Fact]` attribute if you are using xUnit.net. This is to ensure that the test runner can find and execute these tests.

Please note that the code provided seems to be incomplete and some assumptions had to be made.
